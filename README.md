## Features

*   Generates horror stories and titles using the Mistral AI API.
*   Posts the generated stories to a Reddit profile.
*   Includes a link to the author's Reddit profile in each post.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   `requests` library
*   `base64` library
*   `os` library
*   `json` library
*   `time` library
*   `logging` library
*   `re` library

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/instax-dutta/reddit-bot.git
    cd reddit-bot
    ```

2.  Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Reddit API Credentials:**
    *   You will need to create a Reddit application to obtain a `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_USERNAME`, and `REDDIT_PASSWORD`.
    *   Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and create a new app.
    *   Choose "script" as the type.
    *   Set a descriptive name for your app.
    *   Set a redirect URI (can be anything, e.g., `http://localhost`).
    *   After creating the app, you will get a `client_id` (which is the `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`) and a `client_secret` (which is the `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`).
    *   Set your Reddit username and password.

2.  **Mistral AI API Key and Agent ID:**
    *   You will need a Mistral AI API key and Agent ID.
    *   Sign up for an account at [https://mistral.ai/](https://mistral.ai/).
    *   Create an API key in your account dashboard.
    *   Find or create an agent ID.

3.  **Update the code:**
    *   Open `bot.py` and replace the placeholder values for the following variables with your actual credentials:
        *   `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
        *   `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
        *   `REDDIT_USERNAME`
        *   `REDDIT_PASSWORD`
        *   `MISTRAL_API_KEY`
        *   `MISTRAL_AGENT_ID`

## Running the Bot

1.  Run the `bot.py` script:

    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```

    The bot will generate and post stories to your Reddit profile.

## Important Notes

*   The script stores the Reddit access token in a `token.txt` file.  This file is also added to the .gitignore file.
*   The bot posts a new story every hour.
*   Ensure you have the necessary permissions on your Reddit account to post to your profile.
